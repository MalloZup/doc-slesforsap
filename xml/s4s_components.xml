      Definitions:
      + scale-up: adding more resources to an existing system
      + scale-out: adding complementary systems to your existing ones

      From my outsider's view, replication actually seems orthogonal to either
      of these, as it is possible with either scale-up or scale-out scenarios.

      Fixme/12 SP2: Are scale-out scenarios supported? FATE#318793

     <para>
      This resource agent from SUSE supports scale-up scenarios by checking the
      &hana; database instances for whether a failover needs to happen.
     </para>
     <para>
      It is configured as a master/slave resource. In scale-up scenarios,
      the master assumes responsibility for the &hana; databases
      running in primary mode, whereas the slave is responsible for instances
      that are operated in synchronous (secondary) status. In the case of a
      failover, the slave can automatically become the master.
     </para>
     <para>
      The following scale-up scenarios are supported through this resource
      agent:

        <para>
         Two systems (A and B) within the same &sleha; cluster, one primary (A)
         and one secondary (B). The primary system (A) is
         replicated synchronously to the secondary system (B).

        <para>
         Two systems (A and B) within the same &sleha; cluster, one primary (A)
         and one secondary (B). The primary system (A) is
         replicated synchronously to the secondary system (B).
        </para>
       </formalpara>
       <para>
        However, the secondary system is also used for non-productive purposes
        (such as a development or QA database). If a failover occurs, the
        resources for the production database are increased as quickly as
        possible.

        <title>Chain/Multi-Tier Scenario</title>
        <para>
         Three systems (A, B, and C), of which two are located within the
         same &sleha; cluster (A and B) and the third system is located (C)
         externally. The primary system (A) is replicated synchronously to the
         secondary system (B). The secondary system (B) is
         replicated asynchronously to the external system (C).
        </para>
       </formalpara>
       <para>
        When a failover from A to B occurs, the connection to C is broken to
        allow the former secondary system (B) to replicate to the
        former primary system (A). This is necessary because a system can only
        be replicated to a single other system.

     <para>
      To make configuring the cluster as simple as possible, SUSE has
      developed the <systemitem>SAPHanaTopology</systemitem> resource agent.
      This agent runs on all
      nodes of a &sleha; cluster and gathers information about the status and
      configurations of &hana; system replications. It is designed as a
      normal (stateless) clone.

  <title>&supmedia;</title>

  <para>
   The idea behind &supmedia; is to enable
   partners or customers to add their own tasks or workflows to the
   Installation Wizard.
  </para>

  <para>
   This is done by adding a small XML file, which will be part of an &ay;
   XML file. This file must be called <filename>product.xml</filename>; then
   it will be included in the workflow.
  </para>

  <para>
   This can be used for various types of additions, such as adding your own
   RPMs, running your own scripts, setting up a cluster file system or
   creating your own dialogs and scripts.
  </para>

  <sect2 xml:id="sec.s4s.component.supplement.productxml">
   <title><filename>product.xml</filename></title>
   <para>
    The <filename>product.xml</filename> file looks like a normal &ay;
    XML file, but with some restrictions.
   </para>
   <para>
    The restrictions relate to the fact that only the parts for the second
    stage of the installation can be run, because the first stage was
    executed before.
   </para>
   <para>
    Both XML files (<filename>autoyast.xml</filename> and
    <filename>product.xml</filename>) will be merged after the media is read
    and a <quote>new</quote> &ay; XML file is generated on the fly for
    the additional workflow.

   <title>Own &ay; Ask Dialogs</title>

    For a general overview and details of the Ask feature of &ay;, see
    Chapter 4.19. <quote>Ask the User for Values During Installation</quote>
    of the SLES <emphasis>&ay; Guide</emphasis> (the <emphasis>&ay;
    Guide</emphasis> comes with the product or is available from
    <link xlink:href="http://www.suse.com/documentation/sles-12/"/>).
   </para>
   <para>
    For the &supmedia;, you can only use dialogs within the
    <literal>cont</literal> stage
    (<literal>&lt;stage&gt;cont&lt;/stage&gt;</literal>), which means they
    are executed after the first reboot.
   </para>
   <para>
    Your file with the dialogs will be merged with the base &ay; XML
    file.
   </para>
   <para>
    As a best practice, your dialog should have a dialog number and an
    element number, best with steps of 10. This helps to include later
    additions and could be used as targets for jumping over a dialog or
    element dependent on decisions. We also use this in our base dialogs and
    if you provide the right dialog number and element number, you can place
    your dialog between our base dialogs.
   </para>
   <para>
    You can store the answer to a question in a file, to use it in one of
    your scripts later. Be aware that you <emphasis>must</emphasis> use the
    prefix <literal>/tmp/ay</literal> for this, because the Installation
    Wizard will copy such files from the <filename>/tmp</filename> directory
    to the directory where your media data also will be copied. This is done
    because the next supplemenary media could have the same dialogs or same
    answer file names and would overwrite the values saved here.

   ClamSAP is a shared library that links between ClamAV and the virus
   scan interface of SAP (NW-VSI). An example use case of it would be allowing
   an SAP application to scan for malicious uploads in HTTP uploads.
   To use virus scanning within SAP applications, you can use the
   Virus Scan Interface in SAP (transaction VSCAN).
