  <title>The Installation Wizard</title>

   <para>The Installation Wizard offers a guided installation path for both,
   the &sls; operating system and the SAP applications.</para>

   <para>Additionally, it is an installation framework for third party
   extension.</para>

   <title>Supplement Media</title>
   <para>
The basic idea of the “Supplement Media” is to enable partners or customers to add own tasks or workflows to the Installation Wizard based installation.
   </para>
   <para>
It is done by a small XML file, which is not different as a part of an &ay; XML file. This file must be called <filename>product.xml</filename>; then it will be included into the work flow.
   </para>
   <para>
This can be used for various types of additions, e.g. adding your own
RPMs, running your own scripts up to setting up a cluster file system or
creating your own dialogs and scripts.
   </para>

   <sect3>
    <title><filename>product.xml</filename></title>

    <para>
The <filename>product.xml</filename> looks like a normal &ay;
XML file, but with some restrictions.
    </para>
    <para>
The restriction are coming from the circumstance that only the parts for the second stage of the installation could be run, because the first stage was executed before.
    </para>
    <para>
Both XML files (<filename>autoyast.xml</filename> and
<filename>product.xml</filename>) will be merged after the media is read
and a <quote>new</quote> &ay; XML file is generated on the fly for the
further workflow.
    </para>
    <para>
     The following areas or sections will be merged:
    </para>
<screen><![CDATA[<general> section
  <ask-list>         (see 2)
  ...
<software> section   (see 3)
  <post-packages>
  ...
<scripts> section
  <chroot-scripts>   (after the package installation, before the first boot)
  <post-scripts>     (during the first boot of the installed system, no
                      services running)
  <init-scripts>     (during the first boot of the installed system, all
                      services up and  running)
  ...]]></screen>
<para>
All other sections will be replaced.
</para>

<para>

 Guide, Chapter <quote>4.12. Custom user scripts</quote>.
</para>

   <sect3>
    <title>Own &ay; Ask Dialogs</title>
    <para>
For a general overview and the details of the Ask feature of &ay;, see Chapter <quote>4.17.  Ask the user for values during installation</quote> of the SLES &ay; Guide.
    </para>
    <para>
For the supplement media you can only use dialogs within the
<literal>cont</literal> stage
(<literal><![CDATA[<stage>cont</stage>]]></literal>), which means they
are executed after the first reboot.
    </para>
    <para>
Your file with the dialogs will be merged with the base &ay; XML file.
    </para>
    <para>
As a best practice, your dialog should have a dialog number and an
element number, best with steps of 10. This helps to include later
additions and also could be used as targets for jumping over a dialog or
element dependent on decisions. We use this too in our base dialogs and
if you provide the right dialog number and element number you can place
you dialog between our base dialogs.
    </para>
    <para>
You can store the answer to a question in a file, to use it in one of
your scripts later.  Be aware that you <emphasis>must</emphasis> use the
prefix <literal>/tmp/ay</literal> for this, because the Installation
Wizard will copy such files from the <filename>/tmp</filename> directory
to the directory where your media data also will be copied.  This is
done because the next supplement media, could have the same dialogs or
same answer file names and would overwrite the values saved here.
    </para>
    <para>
     Here is an example with several options:

    <para>
You can also install rpm packages within the
