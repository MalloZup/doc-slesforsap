     <para>
      &sles4sap; includes Extended Service Pack Overlap Support which
      extends the overlap between the support periods of two consecutive
      service packs by one year.
      Within this period, you remain under full support and
      receive all relevant maintenance updates.
      As a standard offering, this is unique.
    </para>
    <para>
      Extended Service Pack Overlap Support allows you to perform
      service pack migrations within 18 months instead of only 6 months.
      Migrations can be scheduled more easily and testing before a migration
      can be performed under lesser time constraints.

      Subscriptions for &sles4sap; include SUSE Linux Enterprise Server
      Priority Support for SAP Applications which offers technical support for
      &sles4sap; directly from SAP. The joint support infrastructure,
      used by support engineers from &suse; Technical Support and SAP, is
      based upon SAP Solution Manager and offers a seamless communication
      with both SAP and &suse;. This <quote>One Face to the Customer</quote>
      support model reduces complexity and lowers the total cost of ownership.
