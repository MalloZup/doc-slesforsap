  <title>Software Repository Setup</title>

  <para>
   Software included with operating systems based on &sle; are delivered as
   RPM packages, a form of installation package that can have dependencies on
   other packages. On a server or an installation medium, these packages are
   stored in software repositories (sometimes also called
   <quote>channels</quote>).
  </para>
  <remark>
   FIXME: "variant" is maybe not a good word... - sknorr, 2016-06-17
  </remark>
  <para>
   By default, computers running &productname; are set up to receive
   packages from multiple repositories. Of each of the standard repositories,
   there is a <quote>Pool</quote> variant that represents the state of the
   software when it was first shipped. There is also an <quote>Update</quote>
   variant that includes the newest maintenance updates for the software
   in the <quote>Pool</quote> variant.
  </para>

   If you registered your system during installation, your repository
   setup should include the following:

    <listitem>
     <para>
      &sles4sap; includes Extended Service Pack Overlap Support which
      extends the overlap between the support periods of two consecutive
      service packs by one year.
      Within this period, you remain under full support and
      receive all relevant maintenance updates.
      As a standard offering, this is unique.
    </para>
    <para>
      Extended Service Pack Overlap Support allows you to perform
      service pack migrations within 18 months instead of only 6 months.
      Migrations can be scheduled more easily and testing before a migration
      can be performed under lesser time constraints.
     </para>
     <para>
      At additional cost, &suse; also offers Long Term Service Pack Support
      (LTSS). With LTSS, you receive support for a particular service pack
      after ESPOS has run out. For more information about the life cycle of
      &suse; products, see:

      Subscriptions for &sles4sap; include SUSE Linux Enterprise Server
      Priority Support for SAP Applications which offers technical support for
      &sles4sap; directly from SAP. The joint support infrastructure,
      used by support engineers from &suse; Technical Support and SAP, is
      based upon SAP Solution Manager and offers a seamless communication
      with both SAP and &suse;. This <quote>One Face to the Customer</quote>
      support model reduces complexity and lowers the total cost of ownership.
