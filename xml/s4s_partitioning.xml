  <title>Partitioning for the SAP System (stage 2)</title>

  <para>
   The partitioning for the SAP system is done by the &sapwiz;
   and can only take place after the operating system has been installed.
   That means the partitions are created either during the installation workflow
   after the reboot or in the running system.
  </para>

    <filename>autinst.xml</filename> Cannot Be Used Here
   </title>
   <para>
    <filename>autoinst.xml</filename> is only used for the installation
    of the operating system.
    It cannot control the partitioning for the SAP system.

   According to varkoly, Netweaver stuff generally needs 80GB (or more) to
   itself, HANA needs 60GB to itself. Should I put this here or is this info
   too info...rmal? - sknorr, 2016-01-21

  <para>
   Partitioning for the SAP system is controlled by the files from the directory
   <filename>/usr/share/YaST2/include/sap-installation-wizard/</filename>.
   Depending on the SAP application being installed and your hardware, different
   files will be chosen, using the definitions in
   <filename>/etc/sap-installation-wizard.xml</filename>.
   Here, the content of the element <tag>partitioning</tag> is
   decisive.
  </para>
  <para>
   If the installation is, for example, based on HA or a distributed database,
   no partitioning is needed. In this case,
   <tag>partitioning</tag> is set to <literal>NO</literal>,
   the file <filename>base_partitioning.xml</filename> is used.
  </para>

   Not happy with "based on HA"... Can sth be based on HA? Would
   "high-availability system" or so work? - sknorr, 2016-01-25
  </remark>
  <remark>
   The old guide claimed that base_partitioning.xml does nothing. True?
   Does not really look like it, but I am no expert. - sknorr, 2016-01-25

  <para>
   The files that control partitioning are &ay; control
   files that contain a <tag>partitioning</tag> section only.
   However, these files allow using several extensions to the &ay; format:
  </para>

  <itemizedlist>
   <listitem>
    <para>
     If the <tag>partitioning_defined</tag> tag is set to
     <literal>true</literal>, the partitioning will be performed without any
     user interaction.
    </para>
    <para>
     This is used, for example, when creating &hana; file systems on systems
     certified for &hana; (such as from Dell, Fujitsu, HP, IBM, or Lenovo).
    </para>
   </listitem>
   <listitem>
    <para>
     For every partition, you can specify the
     <tag>size_min</tag> tag. The size value can be given as
     a string in the format of
     <literal><replaceable>RAM</replaceable>*<replaceable>N</replaceable></literal>.
     This way you can specify how large the partition should minimally be
     (<replaceable>N</replaceable> times the size of the available
     memory (<replaceable>RAM</replaceable>)).

    The steps below illustrates how to create a partitioning setup for TREX.
    However, creating a partitioning setup for other applications works
    analogously.
   </para>
   <step>
    <para>
     In
     <filename>/usr/share/YaST2/include/sap-installation-wizard/</filename>,
     create a new XML file. Name it <filename>TREX_partitioning.xml</filename>,
     for example.
    </para>
   </step>
   <step>
    <para>
     Copy the content of <filename>base_partitioning.xml</filename> to your new
     file and adapt the new file to your needs.
    </para>
   </step>
   <step>
    <para>
     Finally, adapt <filename>/etc/sap-installation-wizard.xml</filename> to
     include your custom file.
     In the <tag>listitem</tag> for <literal>TREX</literal>, insert the
     following line:
