  <title>Partitioning for the Operating System (stage 1)</title>

  <para>
   During the installation of the operating system, partitions for the
   operating system are created.
  </para>

  <para>
   A logical volume group (LVG) named <literal>/dev/system</literal> will be
   created. This LVG contains two logical volumes (LVs):

     should not be set smaller than 5 GB)

      5GB min is from old guide. Only double-check with varkoly, seemed

  <title>Partitioning for the SAP System (stage 2)</title>

  <para>
   The partitioning for the SAP system is done by the &sapwiz;
   and can only take place after the operating system has been installed.
   That means the partitions are created either during the installation workflow
   after the reboot or in the running system.
  </para>

    <filename>autinst.xml</filename> Cannot Be Used Here

   <para>
    <filename>autoinst.xml</filename> is only used for the installation
    of the operating system.
    It cannot control the partitioning for the SAP system.
   </para>

  <para>
   Depending on the product you are installing and your particular use case,
   the amount of hard disk space necessary can vary. Consider the
   following minimal amounts:
  </para>
  <itemizedlist>
   <listitem>
    <formalpara>
     <title>&netweaver;</title>
     <para>At least 80 GB of hard disk space are necessary.</para>

  <para>
   Partitioning for the SAP system is controlled by the files from the directory
   <filename>/usr/share/YaST2/include/sap-installation-wizard/</filename>.
   Usually, <filename>base_partitioning.xml</filename> will be used.
   When installing &hana; on certified hardware, other files will be chosen,
   as defined in <filename>/etc/sap-installation-wizard.xml</filename>.
   Here, the content of the element <tag>partitioning</tag> is
   decisive.
  </para>
  <para>
   If the installation is, for example, based on HA or a distributed database,
   no partitioning is needed. In this case,
   <tag>partitioning</tag> is set to <literal>NO</literal>,
   the file <filename>base_partitioning.xml</filename> is used.
  </para>

  <remark>
   Not happy with "based on HA"... Can sth. be based on HA? Would
   "high-availability system" or so work? According to pschinagl, this refers
   to the SAP app installation type that can be chosen SIW - sknorr, 2016-01-25
  </remark>
  <remark>
   The old guide claimed that base_partitioning.xml does nothing. True?
   Does not really look like it, but I am no expert. Are base_part and NO really
   the same thing? - sknorr, 2016-01-25
  </remark>

  <para>
   The files that control partitioning are &ay; control
   files that contain a <tag>partitioning</tag> section only.
   However, these files allow using several extensions to the &ay; format:
  </para>

  <itemizedlist>
   <listitem>
    <para>
     If the <tag>partitioning_defined</tag> tag is set to
     <literal>true</literal>, the partitioning will be performed without any
     user interaction.
    </para>
    <para>
     By default, this is only used when creating &hana; file systems on systems
     certified for &hana; (such as from Dell, Fujitsu, HP, IBM, or Lenovo).
    </para>
   </listitem>
   <listitem>
    <para>
     For every partition, you can specify the
     <tag>size_min</tag> tag. The size value can be given as
     a string in the format of
     <literal><replaceable>RAM</replaceable>*<replaceable>N</replaceable></literal>.
     This way you can specify how large the partition should minimally be
     (<replaceable>N</replaceable> times the size of the available
     memory (<replaceable>RAM</replaceable>)).

    The steps below illustrates how to create a partitioning setup for TREX.

   <step>
    <para>
