 <para>
 1. Insert the SUSE Linux Enterprise Server for SAP Applications 11 disk into
    the DVD Drive and boot from DVD.
 2. From the boot screen select "Install SLES for SAP Applications" (for
    Media-Changer supported installation), "Install SLES for SAP Applications —
    Basic" (for automatic SLES for SAP Applications installation) "Install SLES
    for SAP Applications — Manual Profile via USB" (for other installation
    methods, see below).
 3. Press enter to start the installation.

Installation of SUSE Linux Enterprise Server for SAP Applications

Linux installation will start (partitioning, LVM setup and file system
creation, installation of Linux software packages). This step takes typically
less than 10 min. (depends on hardware). After the automatic system reboot (don't change
the default "Boot from Hard Disk" in case you left the DVD inserted), you will
be prompted to insert the SAP installation media: follow the instructions.

Installation of SUSE Linux Enterprise Server for SAP Applications — Basic

The process is similar to SUSE Linux Enterprise Server for SAP Applications.
Linux installation will start (partitioning, LVM setup and file system
creation, installation of Linux software packages). This step takes typically
less than 10 min. (depends on hardware). After the automatic system reboot (don't change
the default "Boot from Hard Disk" in case you left the DVD inserted), the
system will provide some dialogs for basic system settings. The Media-Changer
will not start for installation of a validated SAP solution, if Media-Changer
should be used to install a validated SAP solution it can be started manually
within YaST.

Installation of SUSE Linux Enterprise Server for SAP Applications — Manual

In order to use a custom AutoYaST script or perform a complete manual 
installation and configuration of SUSE Linux Enterprise Server for SAP
Applications select the "Install SLES for SAP Applications   Manual Profile via
USB" boot menu entry. Within the boot options change the "autoyast=usb:///"
parameter to the location of a custom AutoYaST script to use for automatic
installation, or completely remove the "autoyast=usb:///" parameter to perform
a manual installation and configuration of SUSE Linux Enterprise Server for SAP
Applications. You can choose the SAP specific pattern, the HA, WebYaST
components and SAP specific IBM Java as well in this path, but they are NOT
preselected.

SAP specific instructions

For further installation instructions, the SAP specific parts in particular,
please refer to the SAP Installation Guide (the "Cookbook").

Installation options in the DVD menu

  • Install SLES for SAP Applications
 
    The normal AutoYaST driven SLES for SAP Applications installation including
    SAP solution installation using the SAP Media-Changer for the customer (as
    described in "Installation of SUSE Linux Enterprise Server for SAP
    Applications")
  • Install SLES for SAP Applications — Basic

    The normal AutoYaST driven SLES for SAP Applications installation without
    using the SAP Media-Changer for the customer (as described in "Installation
    of SUSE Linux Enterprise Server for SAP Applications — Basic")
  • Install SLES for SAP Applications — Manual Profile via USB

    AutoYaST will look on USB devices for the XML configuration file. Plug in
    an USB device and store your config in a way like it is on the DVD in the "
    /rules" directory (as described in "Installation of SUSE Linux Enterprise
    Server for SAP Applications — Manual")

How to install with installation media from the network

 1. Copy the SUSE Linux Enterprise Server for SAP Applications DVD content to a
    webserver (for example myserver.com) into the directory "/srv/www/htdocs/
    mydir"
 2. Boot from DVD
 3. Choose one of the bootmenu options and edit the command line: Remove the
    parameters "instmode=cd netsetup=0" from the commandline and change
    autoyast=file:/// to autoyast=http://myserver.com/mydir/ and add a
    parameter install=http://myserver.com/mydir

    That's all you need for a network installation. If you want to avoid using
    a DVD to bootstrap the system and boot from the network via PXE, read the
    documentation about setting up a PXE environment ( http://www.suse.de/~ug/
    autoyast_doc/bootmedium.html ).

Media Changer and Network Sources

If you want to put your media on a NFS Server, do it like this:

 1. Create a directory /srv/www/htdocs/sap_test on your installation server.
 2. Edit your /etc/exports file on the installation server by adding the
    following:

    /srv/www/htdocs/sap_test *(ro,root_squash,sync)

 3. Create a directory for every SAP Media you have, e.g. "/srv/www/htdocs/
    sap_test/sapcd1"
 4. Copy the content of all SAP Medias to the corresponding directory.

    Now the media changer can also install from your NFS server.
